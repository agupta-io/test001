                <p><b>Offered:</b> Fall 2023</p>
                This course is designed to provide a hardware-centric overview
                of computer systems used in modern computing platforms. From
                the bottom up we will study the architecture of processor
                architectures (e.g., pipelined CPUs, ISA, RISC vs. CISC,
                out-of-order execution) and memory systems (e.g., memory
                hierarchy, caching, DRAM memories). We will understand how to
                evaluate the performance of modern processors and exploit
                parallelism in applications. This includes parallelization
                across multi-core CPUs, GPUs, and specialized hardware. Through
                ands-on assignments and an open-ended project students will
                develop a holistic understanding of modern computer systems and
                how they are designed.

                This graduate level course provides an overview of the holistic
                environmental impact of computing platforms over the course of
                their lifetime. Topics include life cycle analyses of computing
                devices, carbon footprint of computing, computer architecture
                and systems, renewable energy driven data centers, intermittent
                computing, sustainable applications (e.g., AI), and emerging
                technologies. We will understand how to evaluate and consider
                the holistic environmental impact of computing platforms
                including carbon, water, e-waste, and materials used. Through
                reading, analyzing, and discussing papers, and an open-ended
                project students will develop a holistic understanding of the
                environmental impact of computing and designing sustainable
                platforms.
